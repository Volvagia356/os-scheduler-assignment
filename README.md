Assignment for Operating Systems
================================

This is an assignment I did for an operating systems class at the university where I'm studying.
It simulates a bunch of different operating system schedulers.

Python 2.7 is required. setup.py is used with py2exe to generate a Windows exe.

To use, run `scheduler-sim.py` in Python 2.7
